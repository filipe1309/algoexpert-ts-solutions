Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters 
and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
occurs only once.

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function
should return `-1`.

**Sample Input**
```
string = "abcdcaf"
```

**Sample Output**
```
1 // The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
```
