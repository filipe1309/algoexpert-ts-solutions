You're given a 2D array of integers matrix. Write a function that returns the 
transpose of matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is a flipped version of the original matrix across 
its main diagonal (which runs from top left to bottom right); it switches the 
row and column indices of the original matrix.

**Sample Input** #1
```javascript
matrix = [
  [1, 2],
]
```

**Sample Output** #1
```javascript
[
  [1],
  [2],
]
```

**Sample Input** #2
```javascript
matrix = [
  [1, 2],
  [3, 4],
  [5, 6],
]
```

**Sample Output** #2
```javascript
[
  [1, 3, 5],
  [2, 4, 6],
]
```

**Sample Input** #3
```javascript
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9],
]
```

**Sample Output** #3
```javascript
[
  [1, 4, 7],
  [2, 5, 8],
  [3, 6, 9],
]
```
