Write a function that takes in an array of at least three integers and, without 
sorting the input array, returns a sorted array of the three largest integers in 
the input array.

The function should return duplicate integers if necessary; for example, it 
should return `[10, 10, 12]` for an input array of `[10, 5, 9, 10, 12]`.

### Sample Input
```javascript
array = [141, 1, 17, -7, -17, -27, 18, 541, 8, 7, 7]
```

### Sample Output
```javascript
[18, 141, 541]
```
