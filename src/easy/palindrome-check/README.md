Write a function that takes in a non-empty string and that returns a boolean 
representing whether the string is a palindrome. 

A palindrome is defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. 
Note that single-character strings are palindromes.

Sample Input:
```javascript
string = "abcdcba"
```

Sample Output:
```javascript
true // it's written the same forward and backward
```
