The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first number of the sequence is `0`, the second number is `1`, and the nth number is the sum of the (n - 1)th and (n - 2)th numbers. Write a function that takes in an integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci number.

Important note: the Fibonacci sequence is often defined with its first two numbers as `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`. For the purpose of this question, the first Fibonacci number is `F0`; therefore, `getNthFib(1)` is equal to `F0`, `getNthFib(2)` is equal to `F1`, etc..

## Sample input #1
```
n = 2
```

## Sample output #1
```
1 // 0, 1
```

## Sample input #2
```
n = 6
```

## Sample output #2
```
5 // 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5
```
