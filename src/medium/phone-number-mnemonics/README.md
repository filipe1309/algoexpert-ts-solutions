If you open the keypad of your mobile phone, it'll likely look like this:

```
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  1  │  2  │  3  │
│     │ abc │ def │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  4  │  5  │  6  │
│ ghi │ jkl │ mno │
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│  7  │  8  │  9  │
│ pqrs│ tuv │ wxyz│
├─────┼─────┼─────┤
│     │  0  │     │
│     │     │     │
└─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

Almost every digit is associated with some letters in the alphabet; this
allows certain phone numbers to spell out actual words. For example, the phone
number `8464747328` can be written as `timisgreat`;
similarly, the phone number `2686463` can be written as
`antoine` or as `ant6463`.

It's important to note that a phone number doesn't represent a single sequence
of letters, but rather multiple combinations of letters. For instance, the
digit `2` can represent three different letters (a, b, and c).

A mnemonic is defined as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that
assist in remembering something. Companies oftentimes use a mnemonic for their
phone number to make it easier to remember.

Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function that
returns all mnemonics for this phone number, in any order.

For this problem, a valid mnemonic may only contain letters and the digits
`0` and `1`. In other words, if a digit is able to be
represented by a letter, then it must be. Digits `0` and
`1` are the only two digits that don't have letter representations
on the keypad.

Note that you should rely on the keypad illustrated above for digit-letter
associations.

**Sample Input**
```ts
phoneNumber = "1905"
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[
  "1w0j",
  "1w0k",
  "1w0l",
  "1x0j",
  "1x0k",
  "1x0l",
  "1y0j",
  "1y0k",
  "1y0l",
  "1z0j",
  "1z0k",
  "1z0l",
]
// The mnemonics could be ordered differently.
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
The first thing you'll need to do is create a mapping from digits to letters. You 
can do this by creating a hash table mapping all string digits to lists of their 
respective characters.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
This problem can be solved fairly easily using recursion. Try generating all characters 
for the first digit in the phone number one at a time, and for each character, recursively 
performing the same action on the the next digit, and then on the digit after that, 
and so on and so forth until you've done so for all digits in the phone number.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
You can recursively generate characters one digit at a time and store the intermediate 
results in a array. Once you've reached the last digit in the phone number, you can 
add the currently generated mnemonic (stored in the previously mentioned array) to 
a final array that stores all the results.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(4^n * n) time | O(4^n * n) space - where n is the length of the phone number
