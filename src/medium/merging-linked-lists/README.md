You're given two Linked List of potentially unequal length. These Linked Lists potentially
merge at a shared intersection node. Write a function that returns the intersection
node or return `None` / `null` if there is no intersection.

Each `Linked List` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to the
next node in the list or to `None` / `null` if it's the tail of the list.

Note: Your function should return an existing node. It should not modify either
Linked List, and it should not create any new Linked Lists.

**Sample Input**
```ts
linkedListOne = 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4
linkedListTwo = 8 -> 7 -> 1 -> 4
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
1 -> 4 // The lists intersect at the node with value 1
```
