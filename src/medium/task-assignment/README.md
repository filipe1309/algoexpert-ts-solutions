You're given an integer `k` representing a number of workers and an array of positive 
integers representing durations of tasks that must be completed by the workers. 
Specifically, each worker must complete two unique tasks and can only work on one 
task at a time. The number of tasks will always be equal to `2k` such that each worker 
always has exactly two tasks to complete. All tasks are independent of one another 
and can be completed in any order. Workers will complete their assigned tasks in parallel, 
and the time taken to complete all tasks will be equal to the time taken to complete 
the longest pair of tasks (see the sample output for an explanation).

Write a function that returns the optimal assignment of tasks to each worker such
that the tasks are completed as fast as possible. Your function should return a
list of pairs, where each pair stores the indices of the tasks that should be
completed by one worker. The pairs should be in the following format: `[task1, task2]`,
where the order of `task1` and `task2` doesn't matter. Your function can return the
pairs in any order. If multiple optimal assignments exist, any correct answer will be
accepted.

Note: you'll always be given at least one worker (i.e., `k` will always be greater than `0`).

**Sample Input**
```ts
k = 3
tasks = [1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 4]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[
  [0, 2], // tasks[0] = 1, tasks[2] = 5 | 1 + 5 = 6
  [4, 5], // tasks[4] = 1, tasks[5] = 4 | 1 + 4 = 5
  [1, 3], // tasks[1] = 3, tasks[3] = 3 | 3 + 3 = 6
] // The fastest time to complete all tasks is 6.

// Note: there are multiple correct answers for this sample input.
// The following is an example of another correct answer:
// [
//   [2, 4],
//   [0, 5],
//   [1, 3],
// ]
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Start by considering which pairs of tasks will lead to the `longest` possible time
to complete all tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The amount of time it'll take to complete all tasks will be dictated by the pair
of tasks that has the longest total duration. This means that you'll want to avoid
pairing long tasks together.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Since the pair of tasks with the longest total duration is the time it takes for us
to finish all tasks, we want to minimize this pair's duration. To do this, we can
simply pair the shortest-duration task with the longest-duration task and repeat
the process with all other tasks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Start by sorting the tasks array in ascending order. Then, pair the shortest-duration
task with the longest-duration task, and add that pair to some output array, Repeat
this process until you've paired all tasks. This will lead to an optimal pairing,
because your pair of tasks with the longest duration will have the shortest dutarion
that it can possibly have.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of tasks
