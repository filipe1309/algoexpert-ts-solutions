You're given an unordered list of unique integers `nums` in the range `[1, n]`,
where `n` represents the length of `nums + 2`. This means that two numbers in
this range are missing from the list.

Write a function that takes in this list and returns a new list with the two
missing numers, sorted numerically.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
nums = [1, 4, 3]
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
[2, 5] // n is 5, meaning the completed list should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
