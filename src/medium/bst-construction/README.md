Write a `BST` class for a Binary Search Tree. The class should support:

- Inserting values with the `insert` method.
- Removing values with the `remove` method; this method should only remove the 
first instance of a given value.
- Searching for values with the `contains` method.

Note that you can't remove values from a single-node tree. In other words, calling
the `remove` method on a single-node tree should simply not do anything.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

**Sample Usage**
```
// Assume the following BST has already been created:
         10
       /    \
      5      15
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 13   22
 /           \
1            14

// All operations below are performed sequentially.
insert(12):   
         10
       /    \
      5      15
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 13   22
 /        /  \
1        12   14

remove(10):   
         12
       /    \
      5      15
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 13   22
 /           \
1            14

contains(15): true
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
As you try to insert, find, or a remove a value into, in, or from a BST, you will have to traverse the tree's nodes. The BST property allows you to eliminate half of the remaining tree at each node that you traverse: if the target value is strictly smaller than a node's value, then it must be (or can only be) located to the left of the node, otherwise it must be (or can only be) to the right of that node.

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Traverse the BST all the while applying the logic described in Hint #1. For insertion, add the target value to the BST once you reach a leaf (None / null) node. For searching, if you reach a leaf node without having found the target value that means the value isn't in the BST. For removal, consider the various cases that you might encounter: the node you need to remove might have two children nodes, one, or none; it might also be the root node; make sure to account for all of these cases.

<summary>Hint 3</summary>
What are the advantages and disadvantages of implementing these methods iteratively as opposed to recursively?

<details>
<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
Average: O(log(n)) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
Worst: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the BST
