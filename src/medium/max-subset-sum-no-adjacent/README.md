Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the 
maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array.

If the input array is empty, the function should return `0`.

**Sample Input**
```ts
array = [75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
330 // 75 + 120 + 135
```

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Try building an array of the same length as the input array. At each index in this new array, store the maximum sum that can be generated using no adjacent numbers located between index 0 and the current index.
