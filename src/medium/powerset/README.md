Write a function that takes in an array of unique integers and returns its powerset.

The powerset `P(X)` of a set `X` is the set of all subsets of `X`. For example, the
powerset of `[1, 2]` is `[[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]`.

Note that the sets in the powerseet do not need to be in any particular order.

**Sample Input**
```ts
array = [1, 2, 3]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[
  [],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1, 2],
  [3],
  [1, 3],
  [2, 3],
  [1, 2, 3]
]
```
