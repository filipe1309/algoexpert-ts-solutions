Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns if that tree is 
symmetrical. A tree is symmetrical if the left and right subtrees are mirror
images of each other.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a
`right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves
or `None` / `null`.

**Sample Input**
```ts
tree =   1
       /   \
      2     2
     / \   / \
    3   4 4   3
   / \       / \
  6   7     7   6
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
true
```
