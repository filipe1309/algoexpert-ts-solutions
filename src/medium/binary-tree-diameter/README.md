Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its diameter. 
The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of its longest path, 
even if that path doesn't pass through the root of the tree.

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected
to more than two other nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges
between the path's first node and its last node.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right`
child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None`
/ `null`.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
tree =      1
          /   \
         3     2
       /   \ 
      7     4 
    /         \
   8           5
  /              \
 9                6
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
6 // 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
// There are 6 edges between the 
// first node and the last node 
// of this tree's longest path.
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
How can you use the height of a binary tree and the heights of its subtrees to
calculate its diameter?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The length of the longest path that goes through the root of a binary tree is 
the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees (left subtree height + 
right subtree height). The diameter of a binary tree can be calculated by 
taking the maximum of: 1) the maximum subtree diameter (max(left subtree 
diameter, right subtree diameter)); and 2) the length of the longest path that 
goes through the root (left subtree height + right subtree height).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Implement a variation of depth-first search that recursively keeps track of both 
the diameter and the height of a each subtree in the input binary tree. Follow 
Hint #2 to continuously compute these diameters.

<details>
<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
Average case: when the tree is balanced
O(n) time | O(h) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree and 
h is the height of the Binary Tree
