Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its diameter. 
The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of its longest path, 
even if that path doesn't pass through the root of the tree.

A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected
to more than two other nodes. The length of a path is the number of edges
between the path's first node and its last node.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right`
child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None`
/ `null`.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
tree =      1
          /   \
         3     2
       /   \ 
      7     4 
    /         \
   8           5
  /              \
 9                6
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
6 // 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
// There are 6 edges between the 
// first node and the last node 
// of this tree's longest path.
```
