Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be 
square-shaped when n == m) and returns a one-dimensional array of all the 
array's elements in spiral order.

Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes
to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element
has been visited.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
array = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [12, 13, 14, 5],
    [11, 16, 15, 6],
    [10, 9, 8, 7],
]
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ,11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```
