You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the 
maximum number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time. Write a 
function that returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

For example, if you were given a staircase of `height = 3` and `maxSteps = 2` you
could climb the staircase in 3 ways. You could take **1 step, 1 step, then 1 step**,
you could also take **1 step, then 2 steps**, and you could take **2 steps, then 1 step**.

Note that `maxSteps <= height` will always be true.

**Sample Input**
```ts
height = 4
maxSteps = 2
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
5
// You can climb the staircase in the following ways:
// 1, 1, 1, 1
// 1, 1, 2
// 1, 2, 1
// 2, 1, 1
// 2, 2
```
