You're given two Linked Lists of potentially unequal length. Each Linked List
represents a non-negative integer, where each node in the Linked List is a
digit of that integer, and the first node in each Linked List always
represents the least significant digit of the integer. Write a function that
returns the head of a new Linked List that represents the sum of the integers
represented by the two input Linked Lists.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node
pointing to the next node in the list or to `None` / `null` if it's the tail
of the list. The value of each `LinkedList` node is always in the range of
`0 - 9`.

Note: your function must create and return a new Linked List, and you're not
allowed to modify either of the input Linked Lists.

**Sample Input**
```ts
linkedListOne = 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 1 // 1742
linkedListTwo = 9 -> 4 -> 5 // 549
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
1 -> 9 -> 2 -> 2 // 2291
```
