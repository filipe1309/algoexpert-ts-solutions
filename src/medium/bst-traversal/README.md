Write three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an empty array,
traverse the BST, add its nodes' values to the input array, and return that array.
The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order, pre-order, and
post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively.

If you're unfamiliar with tree-traversal techniques, we recommend watching the
Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting
to code.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

**Sample Input**
```
tree =   10
       /     \
      5      15
    /   \       \
   2     5      22
 /
1
array = []
```

**Sample Output**
```
inOrderTraverse: [1, 2, 5, 5, 10, 15, 22] // where the array is the input array
preOrderTraverse: [10, 5, 2, 1, 5, 15, 22] // where the array is the input array
postOrderTraverse: [1, 2, 5, 5, 22, 15, 10] // where the array is the input array
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Realize that in-order traversal simply means traversing left nodes before 
traversing current nodes before traversing right nodes. Try implementing this 
algorithm recursively by calling the inOrderTraverse method on a left node, 
then appending the current node's value to the input array, and then calling the
 inOrderTraverse method on a right node.

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Apply the same logic described in Hint #1 for the two other traversal methods, 
but change the order in which you do things.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
All three methods: O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of nodes in
the BST
