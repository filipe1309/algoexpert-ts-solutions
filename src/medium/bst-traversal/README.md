Write three functions that take in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an empty array,
traverse the BST, add its nodes' values to the input array, and return that array.
The three functions should traverse the BST using the in-order, pre-order, and
post-order tree-traversal techniques, respectively.

If you're unfamiliar with tree-traversal techniques, we recommend watching the
Conceptual Overview section of this question's video explanation before starting
to code.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

**Sample Input**
```
tree =   10
       /     \
      5      15
    /   \       \
   2     5      22
 /
1
array = []
```

**Sample Output**
```
inOrderTraverse: [1, 2, 5, 5, 10, 15, 22] // where the array is the input array
preOrderTraverse: [10, 5, 2, 1, 5, 15, 22] // where the array is the input array
postOrderTraverse: [1, 2, 5, 5, 22, 15, 10] // where the array is the input array
```
