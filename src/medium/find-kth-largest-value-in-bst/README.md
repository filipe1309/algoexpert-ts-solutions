Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive integer `k`
and returns the kth largest integer contained in the BST.

You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that `k` is
less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.

Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as
distinct values. In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing
values `{5, 7, 7}` will be `7`â€”not `5`.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

**Sample Input**
```
tree =   15
       /     \
      5      20
    /   \   /   \
   2     5 17   22
 /   \
1     3
k = 3
```

**Sample Output**
```
17
```
