Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer `k`
and removes the kth node from the end of the list.

The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure should
be mutated (no new structure should be created).

Furthermore, the input head of the linked list should remain the head of the
linked list after the removal is done, even if the head is the node that's
supposed to be removed. In other words, if the head is the node that's
supposed to be removed, your function should simply mutate its
`value` and `next` pointer.

Note that your function doesn't need to return anything.

You can assume that the input Linked List will always have at least two nodes and,
more specifically, at least k nodes.

Each `LinkedList` node has an integer `value` as well as a `next` node pointing to
the next node in the list or to `Node` \ `null` if it's the tail of the list.

**Sample Input**
```ts
head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 // the head node with value 0
k = 4
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
// No output required.
// The 4th node from the end of the list (the node with value 6) is removed.
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Since you are given a Singly Linked List, you do not have access to any of the list's 
nodes' previous nodes. Thus, traversing the entire list and then counting k nodes 
back isn't an option. Is there a way for you to traverse the entire list and to know 
which node is the kth node from the end by the time you reach the final node in the list?

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Can you accomplish the task mentioned in Hint #1 by traversing the list all the while
keeping track of two node at a time. How could this work?

<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Initialize two variables pointing to the first node in the list. Traverse k nodes 
in the list, updating the second variable at every node (that is, take k steps with 
the second variable). Then, traverse the remainder of the list, this time updating 
both the second and the first variables (that is take as many steps with the first 
variable as the number of steps between the kth node from the start and the end of 
the list). Once you reach the end of the list, the first variable should point to 
the kth node from the end.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the number of nodes in the Linked List
