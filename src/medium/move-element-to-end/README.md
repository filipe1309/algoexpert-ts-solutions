You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves 
all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns 
the array.

The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input
array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
array = [2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]
toMove = 2
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] // the numbers 1, 3, and 4 could be ordered differently
```
