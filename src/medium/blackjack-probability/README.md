In the game of Blackjack, the dealer must draw cards until the sum of the
values of their cards is greater than or equal to a
`target` value minus 4. For example, traditional Blackjack uses a
`target` value of 21, so the dealer must draw cards until their
total is greater than or equal to 17, at which point they stop drawing cards
(they "stand"). If the dealer draws a card that brings their total above the
`target` (above 21 in traditional Blackjack), they lose (they
"bust").

Naturally, when a dealer is drawing cards, they can either end up standing
or busting, and this is entirely up to the luck of their draw.

Write a function that takes in a `target` value as well as a
dealer's `startingHand` value and returns the probability that
the dealer will bust (go over the `target` value before
standing). The `target` value will always be a positive integer,
and the `startingHand` value will always be a positive integer
that's smaller than or equal to the `target` value.

For simplicity, you can assume that the dealer has an infinite deck of cards
and that each card has a value between 1 and 10 inclusive. The likelihood of
drawing a card of any value is always the same, regardless of previous
draws.

Your solution should be rounded to 3 decimal places and to the nearest
value. For example, a probability of `0.314159` would be rounded
to `0.314`, while a probability of `0.1337` would be
rounded to `0.134`.

**Sample Input**
```ts
target = 21
startingHand = 15
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
0.45 // Drawing a 2-6 would result in the dealer standing.
// Drawing a 7-10 would result in the dealer busting.
// Drawing a 1 would result in a 16, meaning the dealer keeps drawing.
// Drawing with a 16 results in a 0.5 probability of busting (6-10 all result in busts).
// The overall probability of busting is 0.4 + (0.1 * 0.5)
// (the probability of busting on the first draw + the probability of busting on the second).
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Try first thinking about a simple case. Given a `target` value of
21 and a `startingHand` of 15, how would you calculate the
probability of busting? And how would that probability change if the
`startingHand` changes to 14?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The probability of busting from any given `startingHand` is
`(0.1 * p(startingHand + 1)) + ... + (0.1 * p(startingHand + 10))`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Given the formula for the probability of busting, there will be a lot of
repeated calculations, particularly for large `target` values
with a low `startingHand`. Can you use memoization to prevent
recalculating these values?

O(t - s) time | O(t - s) space - where t is the target, and s is the starting hand
