Imagine you have a set of cities that are laid out in a circle, connected by a circular 
road that runs clockwise. Each city has a gas station that provides gallons of fuel, 
and each city is some distance away from the next city.

You have a car that can drive some number of miles per gallon of fuel, and your goal
is to pick a starting city such that you can fill up your car with that city's fuel,
drive to the next city, refill up your car with that city's fuel, drive to the next
city, and so on and so forth until you return back to the starting city with 0 or more
gallons of fuel left.

This city is called a valid starting city, and it's guaranteed that there will always
be exactly one valid starting city.

For the actual problem, you'll be given an array of distances such that city `i` is
distances[i] away from city `i + 1`. Since the cities are connected via a circular
road, the last city is connected to the first city. In other words, the last distance
in the distances array is equal to the distance from the last city to the first city.
You'll also be given an array of fuel available at each city, where fuel[i] is equal
to the fuel available at city `i`. The total amount of fuel available (from all cities
combined) is exactly enough to travel to all cities. Your fuel tank always starts out
empty, and you're given a positive integer value for the number of miles that your car
can travel per gallon of fuel (miles per gallon, or MPG). You can assume that you will
always be given at least two cities.

Write a function that returns the index of the valid starting city.

**Sample Input**
```ts
distances = [5, 25, 15, 10, 15]
fuel = [1, 2, 1, 0, 3]
mpg = 10
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
4
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Try the brute-force approach to this problem by treating each city as the starting
city and simulating traveling from it to all other cities.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Start at each city, and see if you can return back to the city in question without
running out of gas. If you find a city that you can return to after starting at it
without running out of gas, then it must be the valid starting city, because there
is always exactly one valid starting city.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
You can solve this problem in `O(n)` time. Try use the fact that the amount of gas
is exactly enough to travel around the road once to help you.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
Using the fact stated in Hint #3 and the knowledge that there is always
exactly one valid starting city, you can solve this problem in a single pass
of all cities. Keep track of how much gas you have as you enter a city (before
you fill up at that city); you'll enter the first city with 0 gas. The city
that you enter with the least amount of gas in your tank must be the valid
starting city. This is because you'll never have less gas at another city than
you do when you enter this city, no matter what city you start at. This means
that that this is the valid starting city. See the Conceptual Overview section
of this question's video explanation for a more in-depth explanation.
