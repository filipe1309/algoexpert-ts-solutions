You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and 
width containing only `0`s and `1`s. Each `0` represents land, and each `1` represents 
part of a river. A river consists of any number of `1`s that are either horizontally 
or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent). The number of adjacent `1`s 
forming a river determine its size.

Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical
line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.

Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the
input matrix. The sizes don't need to be in any particular order.

**Sample Input**
```ts
matrix = [
  [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[1, 2, 2, 2, 5] // The numbers could be ordered differently.

// The rivers can be clearly seen here:
// [
//   [1,  ,  , 1,  ],
//   [1,  , 1,  ,  ],
//   [ ,  , 1,  , 1],
//   [1,  , 1,  , 1],
//   [1,  , 1, 1,  ],
// ]
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Since you must return the sizes of rivers, which consist of horizontally and vertically 
adjacent 1s in the input matrix, you must somehow keep track of groups of neighboring 
1s as you traverse the matrix. Try treating the matrix as a graph, where each element 
in the matrix is a node in the graph with up to 4 neighboring nodes (above, below, 
to the left, and to the right), and traverse it using a popular graph-traversal 
algorithm like Depth-first Search or Breadth-first Search.

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
By traversing the matrix using DFS or BFS as mentioned in Hint #1, any time that 
you encounter a 1 you can traverse the entire river that this 1 is a part of (and 
keep track of its size) by simply iterating through the given node's neighboring 
nodes and their own neighboring nodes so long as the nodes are 1s.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Naturally, many nodes in the graph mentioned in Hint #1 will have overlapping neighboring 
nodes, and as you traverse the matrix, you will undoubtedly encounter nodes that 
you have previously visited. In order to prevent mistakenly calculating the same 
river's size multiple times and to avoid doing needless computational work, try 
keeping track of every node that you visit in an auxiliary data structure and only 
performing important computations on unvisited nodes. What data structure would be 
ideal here?

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(wh) time | O(wh) space - where w and h are the width and height of the input matrix
