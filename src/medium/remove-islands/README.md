You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and 
width containing only `0`s and `1`s. The matrix represents a two-toned image, where 
each `1` represents black and each `0` represents white. An island is defined as 
any number of `1`s that are horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally 
adjacent) and that don't touch the border of the image. In other words, a group of 
horizontally or vertically adjacent `1`s isn't an island if any of those `1`s are 
in the first row, last row, first column, or last column of the input matrix.

Note that an island can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight
vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.

You can think of islands as patches of black that don't touch the border of the
two-toned image.

Write a function that returns a modified version of the input matrix, where all of
the islands are removed. You remove an island by replacing it with `0`s.

Naturally, you're allowed to mutate the input matrix.

**Sample Input**
```ts
matrix = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
]
// The islands that were removed can be clearly seen here:

//   [ , 1,  ,  ,  , ],
//   [ ,  , 1,  ,  , ],
//   [ ,  ,  ,  ,  , ],
//   [ ,  , 1, 1,  , ],
//   [ ,  ,  ,  ,  , ],
// ]
```
