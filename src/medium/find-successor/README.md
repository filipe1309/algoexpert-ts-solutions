Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional 
pointer to their parent node) as well as a node contained in that tree and 
returns the given node's successor.

A node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given
node) when traversing its tree using the in-order tree-traversal technique. A
node has no successor if it's the last node to be visited in the in-order
traversal.

If a node has no successor, your function should return `None` / `null`.

Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `parent` node, a `left` child
node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes
themselves or `None` / `null`.

**Sample Input**
```javascript
tree =  1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \ 
   4   5
  /
 6
node = 5
```

**Sample Output**
```javascript
1
// This tree's in-order traversal order is:
// 6 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 3
// 1 comes immediately after 5.
```
