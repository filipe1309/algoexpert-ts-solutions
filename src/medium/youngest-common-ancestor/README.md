You're given three inputs, all of which are instances of an `AncestralTree` class 
that have an `ancestor` property pointing to their youngest ancestor. The first 
input is the top ancestor in an ancestral tree (i.e., the only instance that has 
no ancestor--its `ancestor` property points to `None` / `null`), and the other two 
inputs are descendants in the ancestral tree.

Write a function that returns the youngest common ancestor to the two descendants.

Note that a descendant is considered its own ancestor. So in the simple ancestral
tree below, the youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.
  
```ts
// The youngest common ancestor to nodes A and B is node A.
  A
 /
B
```

**Sample Input**
```ts
// The nodes are from the ancestral tree below.
topAncestor = node A
descendantOne = node E
descendantTwo = node I
          A
       /     \
      B       C
    /   \   /   \
   D     E F     G
 /   \
H     I
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
node B
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
You could try to simultaneously iterate through the ancestors of both input descendants 
until you find a common ancestor; however, if one of the descendants has more ancestors 
than the other (i.e., is lower in the ancestral tree), you won't find the youngest 
common ancestor. How can you get around this problem?

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Start by finding the two input descendants' depths in the ancestral tree. If one 
of them is deeper, iterate up through its ancestors until you reach the depth of 
the higher descendant. Then, iterate through both descendants' ancestors in tandem 
until you find the first common ancestor. Note that at this point, one of the descendants 
will be the ancestor of the lower descendant that is at the same level as the higher 
descendant.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(d) time | O(1) space - where d is the depth (height) of the ancestral tree
