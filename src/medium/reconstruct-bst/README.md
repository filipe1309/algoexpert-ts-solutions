The pre-order traversal of a Binary Tree is a traversal technique that starts at
the tree's root node and visits nodes in the following order:

1. Current node
2. Left subtree
3. Right subtree

Given a non-empty array of integers representing the pre-order traversal of a
Binary Search Tree (BST), write a function that creates the relevant BST and
returns its root node.

The input array will contain the values of BST nodes in the order in which
these nodes would be visited with a pre-order traversal.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

**Sample Input**
```
preOrderTraversalValues = [10, 4, 2, 1, 5, 17, 19, 18]
```

**Sample Output**
```
        10
       /  \
      4   17
     / \    \
    2   5   19
   /        /
  1        18
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Think about the properties of a BST. Looking at the pre-order-traversal nodes
(values), how can you determine the right child of a particular node?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The right child of any BST node is simply the first node in the pre-order
traversal whose value is larger than or equal to the particular node's value.
From this, we know that the nodes in the pre-order traversal that come before
the right child of a node must be in the left subtree of that node.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Once you determine the right child of any given node, you're able to generate
the entire left and right subtrees of that node. You can do so by recursively
creating the left and right child nodes of each subsequent node using the fact
stated in Hint #2. A node that has no left and right children is naturally a
leaf node.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
To solve this problem with an optimal time complexity, you need to realize
that it's unnecessary to locate the right child of every node. You can simply
keep track of the pre-order-traversal position of the current node that needs
to be created and try to insert that node as the left or right child of the
relevant previously visited node. Since this tree is a BST, every node must
satisfy the BST property; by somehow keeping track of lower and upper bounds
for node values, you should be able to determine if a node can be inserted as
the left or right child of another node. With this approach, you can solve
this problem in linear time. See this question's video explanation for a more
detailed explanation of this approach.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
