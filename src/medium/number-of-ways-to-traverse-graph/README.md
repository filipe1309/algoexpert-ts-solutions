You're given two positive integers representing the width and height of a 
grid-shaped, rectangular graph. Write a function that returns the number of ways 
to reach the bottom right corner of the graph when starting at the top left 
corner. Each move you take must either go down or right. In other words, you can 
never move up or left in the graph.

For example, given the graph illustrated below, with `width = 2` and `height = 3`,
there are three ways to reach the bottom right corner when starting at the top
left corner:

```
 _ _
|_|_|
|_|_|
|_|_|
```

1. Down, Down, Right
2. Right, Down, Down
3. Down, Right, Down

Note: you may assume that `width * height >= 2`. In other words, the graph will
never be a 1x1 grid.

**Sample Input**
```ts
width = 4
height = 3
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
10
```
