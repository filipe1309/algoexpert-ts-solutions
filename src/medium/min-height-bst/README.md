Write a function that takes in a non-empty sorted array of distinct integers, 
constructs a BST from the integers, and returns the root of the BST.

The function should minimize the height of the BST.

You've been provided with a `BST` class that you'll have to use to construct the
BST.

Each `BST` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child
node. A node is said to be a valid `BST` node if and only if it satisfies the
BST property: its `value` is strictly greater than the values of every node to
its left; its `value` is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
right; and its children nodes are either valid `BST` nodes themselves or `None` /
`null`.

A BST is valid if and only if all of its nodes are valid `BST` nodes.

Note that the `BST` class already has an `insert` method which you can use if
you want.

**Sample Input**
```
array = [1, 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 15, 22]
```

**Sample Output**
```
         10
       /     \
      2      14
    /   \   /   \
   1     5 13   15
          \       \
           7      22
// This is one example of a BST with min height
// that you could create from the input array.
// You could create other BSTs with min height
// from the same array; for example:
         10
       /     \
      5      15
    /   \   /   \
   2     7 13   22
 /           \
1             14
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
In order for the BST to have the smallest height possible, it needs to be 
balanced; in other words, it needs to have roughly the same number of nodes in
its left subtree as its right subtree.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
How can you use the sorted nature of the input array to construct a balanced BST?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Grab the middle element of the array, and make that element be the root node of 
the BST. Then, grab the middle element between the beginning of the array and 
the first middle element, and make that element be the root of the BST's left 
subtree; similarly, make the middle element between the end of the array and the 
first middle element be the root of the BST's right subtree. Continue this 
approach until you run out of elements in the array.

<summary>Optimal Space &amp; Time Complexity</summary>
O(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the array
