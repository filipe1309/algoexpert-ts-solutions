You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of distinct integers and a
target integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted, and each column is also sorted;
the matrix doesn't necessarily have the same height and width.

Write a function that returns an array of the row and column indices of the target
if it's contained in the matrix, otherwise `[-1, -1]`.

**Sample Input**
```ts
matrix = [
  [1,  4,   7,   12,  15,  1000],
  [2,  5,   19,  31,  32,  1001],
  [3,  8,   24,  33,  35,  1002],
  [40, 41,  42,  44,  45,  1003],
  [99, 100, 103, 106, 128, 1004],
]
target = 44
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
[3, 3]
```
