Write a function that takes in an integer matrix of potentially unequal height and 
width and returns the minimum number of passes required to convert all negative 
integers in the matrix to positive integers.

A negative integer in the matrix can only be converted to a positive integer if
one or more of its adjacent elements is positive. An adjacent element is an
element that is to the left, to the right, above, or below the current element
in the matrix. Converting a negative to a positive simply involves multiplying
it by `-1`.

Note that the `0` value is neither positive nor negative, meaning that a `0` can't
convert an adjacent negative to a positive.

A single pass through the matrix involves converting all the negative integers
that can be converted at a particular point in time. For example, consider the
following input matrix:

```ts
[
  [0, -2, -1],
  [-5, 2, 0],
  [-6, -2, 0]
]
```

After a first pass, only 3 values can be converted to positives:

```ts
[
  [0, 2, -1],
  [5, 2, 0],
  [-6, 2, 0]
]
```

After a second pass, the remaining negative values can all be converted to
positives:

```ts
[
  [0, 2, 1],
  [5, 2, 0],
  [6, 2, 0]
]
```

Note that the input matrix will always contain at least one element. If the
negative integers in the input matrix can't all be converted to positives,
regardless of how many passes are run, your function should return `-1`.

**Sample Input**
```ts
matrix = [
  [0, -1, -3, 2, 0],
  [1, -2, -5, -1, -3],
  [3, 0, 0, -4, -1]
]
```

**Sample Output**
```ts
3
```

## Hints

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
  The brute-force approach to solving this problem is to simply iterate through
  the entire matrix, find all positive values, and change their negative
  neighbors to positive. You then repeat this process until no more negative
  neighbors exist. This approach works, but it doesn't run in an optimal time
  complexity; can you think of a another way to solve this?

</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
The approach discussed in Hint #1 has you look at the same elements in the
matrix multiple times. How can you ensure that you never process the same
element more than once?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
Once a positive value has been found and you change its neighbors to
positives, this positive value can no longer lead to the conversion of any
more negative values. Instead, its neighbors (that you just changed to
positives) have the possibility of changing their own neighbors to positives.
After you change a negative value to positive, you should store its position
so that you can check if it can flip any of its neighbors in the next pass of
the matrix. Can something similar to a breadth-first search help you do this?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
You can solve this problem in `O(w * h)` time, where
`w` and `h` are the width and height of the matrix, by
implementing a breadth-first search, starting from all the positive-value
positions in the array. Initialize a queue that stores the positions of all
positive values, iterate through the queue, dequeue elements out, and consider
all of their neighbors. If any of their neighbors are negative, change them to
positive, and store their positions in a secondary queue. Once the first queue
is empty, increment your number of passes, and iterate through the second
queue you created (the one with the positions of negatives that were changed
to positives). Repeat this process until no values are converted during a
pass.

<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
The approach discussed in Hint #4 can work using either one or two queues. If
you decide to use only one queue, you'll need to differentiate the values that
were already positive when the current pass started from the values that were
changed to positive during the current pass. See the Conceptual Overview
section of this question's video explanation for a more in-depth explanation.
